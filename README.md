Download YouTube audio and play it in the terminal

## Goals
In this project, I was striving to make my first TUI. I also wanted to build a tool that would be useful to me.
Since I listen to wilderness ambiance while I study/program and also like longform podcasts, I was always using 
one or two tabs to have YouTube playing in the background. This was fine for a while, but I couldn't close the 
browser window without cutting the audio. It also ate into my bandwidth becuase even though I was only listening 
to the audio, the video was still playing too. 

So, I decided that my first attempt at a TUI would be to create an app that allows you to scrape high quality
audio from YouTube videos using the Pafy library. I used the Urwid library to create the UI portion of the app.
This project still needs some polishing, which I intend to do soon.
